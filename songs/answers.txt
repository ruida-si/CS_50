1. Based on the table on the top and the 100 songs this person likes:
I would say this person is happy and like dancing.
ItÂ´s on a positive mood.

2. As the table reflects the "mood" of the listener's songs, not his
own personal mood.
I would suggest asking this questions to the person himself, rating 1-9,
being 9 the best mood, for example.
Asking about his energy, his willing to dance and how positive he feels.
